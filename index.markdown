# what have i learned from making?

## process making / testing process
It is important to continally make, and incorporate making throughout our processes of thinking, desiging, and creating.

Making is continually experimental, groundbreaking within the design process, allowing us to access solutions and alternate modes of thought.

Each making experience has something to teach us about our process, product, ideas, or selves.
